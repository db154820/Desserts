    <td>Chocolate Chip Cookie Cake</td>
    <td>3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
1 cup (200g) packed light or dark brown sugar
1 large egg + 1 egg yolk1
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (careful not to overmeasure)
2 teaspoons cornstarch (aka cornflour)
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 and 1/2 cup (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
chocolate buttercream for topping (optional)</td>
    <td>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray a 9-inch pie dish or cake pan with nonstick spray. Set aside.
In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fittedwith paddle attachment, beat the butter for 1
minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the brown sugar and beat on medium speed until
creamy, about 1 minute. Mix in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down
the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. In a separate bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt. On low speed,
 slowly mix into the wet  ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick. Add 1 and 1/4 cups chocolate
 chips and mix for about 5 seconds until evenly disbursed.Press the cookie dough evenly into the prepared pan.
 Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the cake is lightly golden brown (could be up to 30 minutes, depending on your oven). Use a
 toothpick to test for doneness. You may want to cover the cake loosely with aluminum foil after 15 minutes to avoid
 heavy browning around the edges. Remove from the oven and set the pan on a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled,
 use a sharp knife or metal spatula to loosen the sides of the cookie cake from the pan and transfer to a serving dish.
 (Or use can serve directly from the pan.) The chocolate buttercream is optional. Instead, decorate with whipped cream or
 top with vanilla ice cream.Decorate the cooled cookie cake with frosting and remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Depending
 how much frosting you use, you may have some leftover. I used a Wilton 1M tip. Cookie cake remains fresh covered
 tightly at room temperature for up to 3 days.</td>
